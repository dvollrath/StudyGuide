# Escaping the Malthusian world
{: .no_toc }

1. TOC

Historically the world was stuck in a Malthusian situation with stagnant living standards, and those standards were pretty low. But we all live in a world of generally rising living standards and they are very high compared to the past. When, and how, did the world shift from the Malthusian world to the world of sustained growth (as in the Solow model and its variations)?

## Take-off
Let's establish some timing first. The following figure gives you some very long-run estimates of GDP per capita in the UK, Japan, and Mexico. This demonstrates a few features of historical growth.

First, the UK is considered the first case of an industrial revolution which created sustained growth. There had been fits and starts before this, but in the UK we see the first sustained rise in GDP per capita. This starts somewhere around the 1700s. The exact timing is argued over, but we're just after the rough start. Prior to the 1700s living standards in the UK  were pretty flat from around 1000 to 1700. They were a bit higher than in Japan and Mexico, yes, but there wasn't sustained growth.

Second, different areas of the world did experience sustained growth, just later than in the frontier places like the UK. Japan and Mexico start taking off around maybe 1900? And for a while they are on a similar trajectory. Ultimately Japan took another leap to catch up to the UK, while Mexico remains somewhat behind. 

Third, even those places that lag in take-off are still much richer than they were in 1800 or 1700 or 1000. Mexico has not caught up to the UK or Japan, but it is still in better shape in terms of living standards than in 1500.

## What happened?
Welcome to one of the biggest questions and longest-running debates in all of economics. What happened to kick over the UK at first, and then nearly every other country, from Malthusian stagnation to sustained growth. Why did that happen around the 1700s and not earlier - or later? Why did some places start sooner than others? These are "big questions" and we don't have solid answers.

What can we say? We can at least talk about some of the mechanics of how this must have worked. All we are doing here is establishing how a combination of our Malthusian model with finite resources can interact with population growth to deliver sustained growth.
