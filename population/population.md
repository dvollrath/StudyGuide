# Population and Resources
This topic expands the discussion to the role of resources (land, energy) and population growth. It explores under what conditions economic growth is limited by available resources and when resource limits are not binding. This depends in part on the speed of population growth, which adapts to economic conditions as well, helping to determine the effect of resource use.
