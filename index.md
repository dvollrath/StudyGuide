Materials for a course in economic growth based loosely on Jones and Vollrath's "Introduction to Economic Growth". 4th edition (new in 2023) is available through [Norton](https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324059578). The old 3rd edition is still available at [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2Ytb3pB). The 4th edition is improved on several dimensions in terms of presentation of models and concepts, and this Study Guide is geared towards that presentation. It's still useful if you are using the 3rd edition, but there will be some notational differences you'll need to work through.

## Structure
The concept of the study guide is to provide the material in layers. The topics in the left-hand table on contents are the structure of my course on economic growth. The sections within each topic are pitched towards an undergrad student with intermediate economics and basic calc skills. Sub-sections under those sections provide deeper dives into the material, and can require deeper math skills.

## Editing content
All the material in this study guide, including data and code for custom figures, is available on Github. Hit the big old button here to see the repository. Feel free to clone this if you'd like to produce your own custom version. If you have suggestions for the study guide, either send me an e-mail or write up a Markdown file with the content and issue a pull request on Github.
