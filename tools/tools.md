# Tools and Data
Links to code and datasets (either direct or pointers to the page where it is hosted) that are used in my course or are useful for studying growth. 

## Software
We'll use a few free online tools to do data analysis and plotting. At most you will need to sign up on these sites using an e-mail address. But they are no cost and do not require you to install anything on your computer.

- To run Python code [Cliprun](https://cliprun.com). Another good option is [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) that allows you to run code and also add notes and other formatting
- To format fancy figures [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de)
- To host fancy figures and add notes/text [Google sites](https://sites.google.com). Alternatives for simple website creation are fine, this is just the one I'm used to.
- To help figure things out [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app). Again, alternatives like ChatGPT are fine, this is just the one I will use in class. 

## Spreadsheets
There are a few spreadsheets we'll use to look at different concepts or models

- [Present discounted value](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10f4dyDSFZy6SfDpIn3uy1LtUYalMXtVOeu6MbEEjh3w/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Solow simulation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FGNybOjegvTZkxeNIjU42IvEUgqKO_WA2lZvybY3vgk/edit?usp=sharing)
