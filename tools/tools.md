# Tools
This contains links to code and datasets (either direct or pointers to the page where it is hosted) that are used in my course or are useful for studying growth. 

We'll use a few free online tools to do data analysis and plotting
- To run Python code [Cliprun](https://cliprun.com)
- To format fancy figures [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de)
- To host fancy figures and add notes/text [Google sites](https://sites.google.com)

The sub-pages here are for various data sources we'll use to plot interesting things. They include code you can cut/paste.
