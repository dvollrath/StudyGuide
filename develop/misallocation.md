When we talk about production we have just talked about aggregate amounts of capital, K, labor, L, and possibly human capital, h. We haven't been explicit about where or by whom those inputs get used. Economies obviously contain many firms, and those firms have lots of different locations. We are split up into different cities and states. Little bits of capital get used in different establishments in different locations by different workers. Each worker is working with some specific capital in some specific location. 

A very real possibility is that a reason for low or high productivity is that an economy is either very bad or very good at ensuring that all the individual bits of capital and individual workers are allocated in a way to maximize production. Having a heart surgeon work at a rural diner as a line cook is probably a poor use of their human capital, especially if we've taken a line cook and put them to work at a hospital in a major city. Not only would it be dangerous, but even if they *could* produce something, it wouldn't be nearly as valuable as what we'd get if the surgeon and line cook swapped places. There is accumulating evidence that these sorts of misallocations are a meaningful reason for why some countries are poor(er).

## Misallocation across varieties
How do we think about misallocations? The key economic intuition is that misallocation implies that different units of a factor of production have different marginal products, implying "money left of the table" from the perspective of the economy. If the marginal product of one piece of capital (e.g. a building) is high while the marginal product of another (e.g. the building across the street) is low, then we're missing a chance to increase total output. If we could move some economic activity (e.g. some businesses) from the low to the high marginal product building (maybe it has better access to roads) then this would do a few things. First, the businesses that moved into the high MP building would increase their output due to the better location. Second, by adding new businesses we'd probably lower the MP in that building, but that's okay, it's already high. Third, moving businesses *out* of the low MP building would *raise* the MP in that building. Those that remain would have more space, and perhaps it improves their prospects because they have more parking for customers. We could keep getting more output from these businesses if we kept moving them over - *until* the point where the MP's are equal in the two locations. At that point there isn't anything left to gain. Misallocation was the original situation with different marginal products, and a "good" allocation is one where the MP's are identical for different locations.

How do we see this in our models? Take the
