## The changing nature of GDP
The development accounting is kind of crude, just telling us that productivity differences are important in why some countries are rich and others are poor. If we look at their economies from a slightly different perspective, we can see that they differ in some ways that might be able to explain these productivity differences.

That perspective is through the industries that make up GDP. GDP, recall, is the total value of all goods and services produced in a given year in a country. We can chunk up those goods and services into broad categories and look at how much of GDP was coming from each. 
Here, we'll look at three broad categories:
- Extraction: This is agriculture and mining. The products produced are things like raw food items (milk, wheat, chicken), farmed materials like cotton, and natural resources like oil, coal, or timber. 
- Manufacturing: This includes *manufacturing* in the sense of factories producing cars, computers, or processed foods, as well as public utilities (electricity and water supplies) and construction (building homes or commercial offices).
- Services: Kind of everything else. Wholesale and retail trade (Amazon warehouses, the Gap, restaurants), financial and insurance services (banking, etc.), government (teachers, cops, firemen, soldiers), and other.

For a bunch of countries over time we can plot the share of GDP (also called value added) that is attributed to, for example, Extraction. How much of GDP depended on planting or digging up things? That's plotted below against the log of GDP per capita. You can see a clear downward pattern. As countries get rich they do less extraction as a *share* of GDP. That doesn't mean they extract less, it just means that as a fraction of GDP it goes down.

Things are different for Manufacturing. Here, you can see that in very poor countries manufacturing actually gets bigger as a share of GDP as they get richer, but that at a certain point (log GDP per capita of about 9.5) the manufacturing share starts to fall. Again, this doesn't mean very rich countries produce fewer manufacturing goods, they produce *more*. Those goods just make up a smaller *share* of GDP as they get very rich. Note that there is no such thing as a very rich country that is heavily into manufacturing - even Japan and Germany has relatively small shares.

Finally, Services almost invariably become more relevant to GDP as countries get rich. Note that even among poor countries Services account for between 20-40% of GDP. They are always important. But among rich countries they account for around 80% of all economic activity. In that sense rich countries are service economies, even though they still produce a lot of agriculture, mining, and manufacturing.

{: .fact}
> There are consistent patterns among countries in the composition of GDP. Extraction (agriculture, mining) *falls* as a share of GDP as countries get rich. Services (retain, finance, government, etc.) *rise* as a share of GDP as countries get rich. Manufacturing (including construction and utilities) tends to peak when countries are middle income (at around 40% of GDP) and then *falls* as a share of GDP as countries become very rich.
