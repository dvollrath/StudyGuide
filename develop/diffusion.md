## Ideas can be copied
Recall that one of the key properties of ideas was their non-rivalry. You can copy an idea (i.e. use calculus or just-in-time inventory systems) without stopping anyone else from using them. Ideas about how to use factors of production efficiently could be copied by relatively poor countries to make themselves more efficient. We want to be more deliberate about describing how production works in a relatively poor country to try and understand why they might not always reach rich country levels of productivity - meaning they don't adopt all the best ideas.

Let production for a developing country be

$$
Y_t = K_t^{\alpha}(D_th_tL_t)^{1-\alpha}.
$$

This is very similar to what we've used before, but replaced $A_t$ with the term $D_t$. The only reason for the change in naming is that we're going to reserve $A_t$ for the productivity in the rich world, or representing the best possible ideas. The term $D_t$ is going to stand for productivity in the developing country, and represents how many of the best ideas have diffused to this country. As usual, the higher is $D_t$ the higher is GDP (and GDP per capita). The model is identical at this point to the Solow model with just a change of a variable name.
