## Automation and job loss
Timothy Taylor has collected a number of old references to worries about automation and job loss. This is not something new. 

From 1940, [an article titled](https://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2020/01/worries-about-automation-and.html) "Does Machine Displace Men in the Long Run? New Studies Cited as Old Argument is Renewed over Significance of Technological Unemployment" was in the NY Times. Note that this is an *old* argument, as far as they are concerned. 

> The cigar industry is a striking example of mechanization on productivity and employment, for the four-operator cigar machine reduced the amount of labor by 62 per cent as compared with the hand process. In terms of production costs, the reduction in labor time represented a difference in favor of the machine process of at least $3 per thousand of cigars. In 1921 the industry employed 112,000 wage earners ... By 1935 it was estimated that 44,000 hand workers had been severed from the industry due to use of the long-filler cigar machines alone and that concurrently jobs had been provided on the machine for 17,000 new workers, mostly unskilled. 

This quote has two aspects that are important. First, that automation or mechanization lowered the labor necessary per machine, lowered the price of the product, but put a bunch of people out of work. Second, that of the new people who were hired (that didn't quite add up to those who lost jobs), they were mainly *unskilled*. 

In a [different post](https://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2016/03/automation-and-job-loss-fears-of-1927.html?m=1) Taylor cites a 1927 speech by US Labor Secretary James J. Davis. From that speech:

> Take for example the revolution that has come in the glass industry. For a long time it was thought impossible to turn out machines capable of replacing human skill in the making of glass. Now practically all forms of glassware are being made by machinery, some of the machines being extraordinarily efficient. Thus, in the case of one type of bottle, automatic machinery produces forty-one times as much per worker as the old hand processes, and the machine production requires no skilled glass blowers. In other words, one man now does what 41 men formerly did. What are we doing with the men displaced?

Similar worries about displacement. But Davis really gets to a third major issue, which is the *pace* of innovation and the question of whether people could find new jobs.

> To-day when new machines are coming in more rapidly than ever,that period of adjustment becomes a more serious matter. Twenty years ago we thought we had reached the peak in mass production. Now we know that we had hardly begun. ... In the long run new types of industries have always absorbed the workers displaced by machinery, but of late we have been developing new machinery at a faster rate than we have been developing new industries. Inventive genius needs to turn itself in this direction.

As a last example, Taylor finds a [1961 Time Magazine article](https://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2014/12/automation-and-job-loss-fears-of-1964.html) on "The Automation Jobless":

> The number of jobs lost to more efficient machines is only part of the problem. What worries many job experts more is that automation may prevent the economy from creating enough new jobs. ... Throughout industry, the trend has been to bigger production with a smaller work force. ... Many of the losses in factory jobs have been countered by an increase in the service industries or in office jobs. But automation is beginning to move in and eliminate office jobs too. ... In the past, new industries hired far more people than those they put out of business. But this is not true of many of today's new industries. ... Today's new industries have comparatively few jobs for the unskilled or semiskilled, just the class of workers whose jobs are being eliminated by automation.

And this again hits on the *pace* of change. Where do those pushed out by automation go for work?
