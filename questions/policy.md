## Basic relationships

This first figure shows the level of GDP per capita on the y-axis against the share of government spending in GDP on the x-axis. The idea is to see if there is any clear relationship between how "big" government is in terms of the economy and how rich countries are.

There isn't much here the really stands out. For some countries, like China and Mexico, higher goverment shares appear associated with *higher* GDP per capita. But for others, like Japan, higher government shares seem associated with *lower* GDP per capita. But really, you can find almost anything you want in this figure.

We get a similar story if we look at the growth rate of GDP per capita (the 10-year average) against government spending as a share of GDP. In some areas you can tell yourself there is a positive relationship, and in others a negative one. 

Rather than looking at government spending as a fraction of GDP, we could instead think about the tax rate. In this sense, maybe the important thing isn't how much the government spends as a share of GDP, but how they finance it. High tax rates could influence incentives to save, innovate, or work. 

This figure plots the top marginal tax rate in the U.S. from 1949 to the present. As you can see, the general pattern here is that this top marginal rate declines over time, with a few wiggles up and down. It is as high as 90% in the 1950s, and in the mid-30% range more recently. Just a reminder that this is the top *marginal* rate. So this is the rate paid on income over and above some high threshold. It is not the rate paid by someone earning minimum wage, for example.

For comparison, here is the lowest marginal tax rate, the rate paid on that minimum wage, for example. This rate is also slightly lower now than in the past.

In comparison to those two rates, what do we want to see? We want to see whether the growth rate of GDP per capita appears to be substantially different in periods with high tax rates and periods with low tax rates. The following figure plots a rolling 10-year growth rate for the U.S. (meaning that in 2000 it is plotting the annualized growth rate from 1990 to 2000).

Compare this to the figures on tax rates, and there isn't any *obvious* connection. If anything, the period in which tax rates were higher experienced higher growth rates. 

It is very important to note that these figures do not prove *anything*. They are simply allowing to see if there are any really blatant correlations between government spending or tax rates and growth rates or levels. The fact that we don't see anything blatant doesn't mean taxation and government spending don't matter, it just means that their relationship is muddy enough that it we can't make it out from the raw data. One of the purposes of this section is to think about why this relationship could be so muddy.
