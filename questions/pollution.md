## Some facts on pollution
The story with respect to economic growth is mixed. There are several types of pollution that appear to decline as countries become rich, while there are others that have a strong positive relationship to GDP per capita.

Air pollution is one area that appears to get better once countries achieve a certain level of development. [Sulphur dioxide](https://www.epa.gov/so2-pollution/sulfur-dioxide-basics#effects) is the chemical that creates the smell when you light a match. It is also released as a byproduct of burning some fossil fuels. Most important, it creates health issues, both directly by irritating the lungs, but also by helping to form particulate matter in the air which has long-term consequences for people breathing it. It is one of the main air pollutants tracked by the EPA and other agencies.

The figure shows the absolute amount of sulphur dioxide produced for several countries over a long time span. The amounts rose substantially from the late 1800s to the middle of the 20th century, but then in the most developed nations declined after that due in part to more awareness of the health issues. China still has growth in sulphur dioxide production as it continues to expand fossil fuel use.

Globally, these emissions have gone down in the last thirty to forty years.

Looking specifically at the US, you can see a similar downward trend in several types of air pollutants: sulphur dioxide, [nitrogen oxides](https://www.epa.gov/no2-pollution), and [volatile organic compounds](https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/volatile-organic-compounds-impact-indoor-air-quality).

Note that these are absolute amounts. The per-capita production of air pollutants in the US has fallen even faster than this.

[Particulate matter](https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/health-and-environmental-effects-particulate-matter-pm) (PM) is a different sort of air pollution, and this has not seen the same substantial declines as other pollutants. Developed countries like the US and UK seem to have a baseline level of PM pollution that is slightly lower than in places like Kenya or Brazil. The real worries here are places like India and China, which rely heavily on fossil fuel production and where air pollution is substantial.

Particulate matter is the reason you get pictures like this from Delhi of smog limiting visibility to only a few feet.

An entirely different kind of pollution is from plastics. You may be familiar with micro-plastics or the amount of plastic that finds its way into oceans. The amount of plastic pollution appears to be strongly correlated with GDP per capita.

The last one we'll consider here is carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas responsible for global warming. We can look at the trend in CO2 emissions per capita for several countries, and see a few different paths.

The US level peaked from around 1975 to 2005, and then has been in decline, although it is at a much higher level than other countries. Japan and South Korea both had CO2 emissions rise as they became rich, and while Japan's levelled off, South Korea's continues to grow. The UK (and much of the rest of Europe) saw CO2 emissions drop substantially since 2000. China and India have very low per-capita CO2 emissions, consistent with their low levels of GDP per capita, and it remains to be seen how those per-capita emissions respond to further development. 

Of course, from the pollution perspective it is the absolute amount of CO2 that matters, not per-capita.

Here the scale of China's population becomes apparent. Absolute emissions in the US have actually gone down in recent years, as they have in the UK and Japan. From the pollution perspective the question remains how much CO2 China and India will produce as they develop further. If you click on the "log" feature of this figure, you'll get a sense for the big differences in the growth rates of CO2 production, which are substantial.
