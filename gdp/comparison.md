# Comparing living standards in the deep past

## Did life suck?
What we're after here is a comparison of living standards not just with last year or a decade ago, but a century ago or more. Set aside the precise measurement of GDP per capita for the moment. Were people better off before the industrial revolution and the origin of sustained growth in GDP per capita? Or were they better off in a pre-industrial economy based primarily on agriculture?

Jason Hickel wrote an op-ed arguing that rosy outlooks on the decline in poverty (promoted by Bill Gates, in this case) during the 20th century (meaning post-industrial) were wrong. In fact, Hickel argued [poverty increased](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/29/bill-gates-davos-global-poverty-infographic-neoliberal) over time due to industrialization. 

> In other words, Roser’s graph illustrates a story of coerced proletarianisation. It is not at all clear that this represents an improvement in people’s lives, as in most cases we know that the new income people earned from wages didn’t come anywhere close to compensating for their loss of land and resources, which were of course gobbled up by colonisers. Gates’s favourite infographic takes the violence of colonisation and repackages it as a happy story of progress.

That op-ed sparked some responses. Marian Tupy published a reply in three parts, asserting that the "romantic ideal of plentiful past if pure fantasy". The first of those responses is [here](https://capx.co/the-romantic-idea-of-a-plentiful-past-is-pure-fantasy/), which includes this:

> I wish to focus instead on Hickel’s assertion that people in the past didn’t need money “in order to live well”. In fact, lives of ordinary Western Europeans prior to the Industrial Revolution were dismal and fully in accord with Roser’s definition of “absolute poverty.” Put differently, poverty was widespread and it was precisely the onset of industrialisation and global trade that Hickel bemoans, which led to poverty alleviation first in the West and then in the Rest.

The two follow-ups look specifically at [urban poverty](https://capx.co/coal-dust-urban-pigs-and-sewage-the-grim-reality-of-pre-industrial-europe/) in the past, and then [rural poverty](https://humanprogress.org/article.php?p=1779). That last link cites work by historian Carlo Cipolla, who said the following:

> “We do know,” Cipolla writes, “that the mass [of the population] lived in a state of undernourishment. This gave rise, among other things, to serious forms of avitaminosis. Widespread filth was also the cause of troublesome and painful skin diseases. To this must be added in certain areas the endemic presence of malaria, or the deleterious effects of a restricted matrimonial selection, which gave rise to cretinism.”

## Conditions in 1915

A good question. How much money would it take for you to agree to live 100 years ago? Would you go back in time if you could be a millionaire in 1920? Would you do it if you could be a billionaire in 1920? Don Boudreax took on that question, and makes the argument that [you would not do it](https://cafehayek.com/2016/02/40405.html) even if you were as rich as John D. Rockefeller, the richest person around a century ago. To give one reason, think about a world with no anti-biotics.
