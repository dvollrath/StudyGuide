# Problems from the textbook
The pages here contain answers and explanations for the end-of-chapter questions in the textbook. If these were published as a separate answer key for instructors, it would take all of five minutes for them to be scanned and posted online. I'd rather provide full explanations and interactive ways of understanding the problems here than try and keep them hidden.
