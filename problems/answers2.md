# Chapter 2 problems

## Question 1
These are short questions to check your understanding of the basics of the Solow model.

### Part A
If $s_I = 0.2$, $g_L = 0.01$, $g_A = 0.02$, and $\delta = 0.05$, what is the steady state capital/output ratio? 

Using equation 2.19, the steady state capital ratio is $K/Y = s_I/(\delta + g_A + g_L)$, so in this case the specific answer is $K/Y = 0.2/(0.05 + 0.02 + 0.01) = 2.5$.

### Part B
In steady state, what is the growth rate of the capital stock, $g_K$, in the Solow model? 

Figure 2.2 established that regardless of the starting value of $K/AL$, it always moves until it reaches a steady state. At that steady state it must be that $g_K = g_A + g_L$, such that the numerator and denominator of $K/AL$ grow at the same rate. 

### Part C
If the economy is at the Golden Rule level of consumption, what is the rate of return on capital, $r$?

If the economy is at the Golden Rule, then it must be that $s_I^{GR} = \alpha$, as in equation 2.24. From equation 2.20 we know that in steady state the return on capital is $r^{ss} = \alpha (g_A + g_L + \delta)/s_I$. Combining those two pieces of information, then $r^{ss} = g_A + g_L + \delta$ at the Golden Rule.

### Part D
Along a balanced growth path, what is the growth rate of consumption per capita?

Along a BGP it is the case that $g_C = g_Y$, so therefore $g_C = g_A + g_L$. The growth rate of consumption per capita is $g_c = g_C - g_L$, so $g_c = g_A$ along a BGP. In other words, consumption per capita has to grow at the same rate as GDP per capita along a BGP to be consistent with the assumption that the fraction of GDP consumed stays constant.

### Part E
Along a balanced growth path, does $s_I$ affect the growth rate or the level of GDP per capita?

Section 2.3.1 went over the effect of $s_I$ on the economy. In Figure 2.5 it shows that changing $s_I$ would impact the *level* of GDP per capita along a BGP, but that the growth rate of GDP per capita would remain equal to $g_A$.

### Part F
In the expression $g_y = \alpha(g_K - g_A - g_L) + g_A$, what term(s) capture the concept of "transitional growth".

The $\alpha(g_K - g_A - g_L)$ term captures transitional growth that takes place while the economy moves from an initial value of $K/AL$ towards the steady state.

## Question 2
For each of the following scenarios, assume that the economy begins in a steady state. For each scenario, draw three figures showing how each of the following terms evolve over time: the growth rate of GDP per capita, the log of GDP per capita, and the size of the $K/AL$ ratio. 

### Part A
The gross capital formation rate, $s_I$, drops to a lower value and stays there permanently.

Answering this requires you to evaluate the dynamics of the Solow model as in Section 2.3.1 or 2.3.2. In this case, the situation inovlves a shift *down* in $s_I$, the opposite of what is discussed in Section 2.3.1. Hence the results should look opposite as well. In words, what happens is that after this change, the actual $K/AL$ ratio is now higher than the steady state $K/AL$ ratio, and hence $g_K$ falls to something less than $g_A + g_L$. Slower capital growth means slower growth in GDP per capita, so that $g_y < g_A$ as the economy transitions to the new steady state. The level of the BGP in GDP per capita shifts down as well, as the steady state value of $K/AL$ is lower.

To see this in figures that the problem asks for, it is helpful to use the following app. 

### Part B
The population growth rate, $g_L$, rises to a higher value and stays there permanently.

You can analyze this problem in the same manner. In the end
