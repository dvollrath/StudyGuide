# Incentives to innovate

## Profits!
This isn't hard. We think innovation occurs because people want to get *paid*. Companies get started with new products because the founders want to make money. Existing comparies hire R&D workers to invent or improve products so that they can make more money. Individual workers will generate new ideas and ways of doing things to get noticed by a boss and ... make more money. 

The motivation is straightforward, but there are some subtleties to it, which in this clip the underpants gnomes don't quite get. Warning, salty language at the end:

Let's generalize this. The first step, "collect underpants" is a highly specific activity that may or may not generate innovation (who knows?). Think of this first step instead as "do research and development", or even more generally "exert some effort to try and come up with a new idea". The gnomes are putting in that effort.

The second step is where things break down for these guys, and where we need to fill in more information. What allows the generator of a new idea get to stage 3 and profit from that idea? The answer is that they need some form of ownership. They need to make that idea *exclusive* to them, so they can force others to *pay* them for using that idea.

## Excludable things
This notion of exclusivity is the key to generating profits from innovation. If refers to a property of goods, services, or ideas. Something is *excludable* if you have some legal or physical way of preventing someone from using that something (i.e. excluding them). In practice, this means that you can force someone to *pay* your to use that something. In order for you to make money selling *anything*, it has to be excludable. Non-excludable means the opposite, and refers to things that it is hard or impossible to prevent people from using, and therefore hard or impossible to charge them for.

You might be thinking of the concept of rivalry and non-rivalry right now. But be careful, excludability and rivalry are *different*. I like this video because Rohen (who does a lot of good economics tutoring videos) does a nice quick job of explaining the distinction, and in giving you some idea of how the two concepts of rivalry and excludability interact.

The key square for us here is the non-rival, excludable square, which are "artifically scarce" goods. The ideas that generate productivity growth are non-rival, as discussed before. That non-rivalry is what allows growth to occur. But to provide incentives for people to spend effort (R&D spending and time) those non-rival ideas have to be made excludable, or artifically scarce. 

How do we do that? The most obvious answer is intellectual property (IP) law: patents, copyrights, trademarks, and the like. This video is an explainer from out of the UK, so some of the minor details are not going to be true for the US. However, it gives you a good introduction to the separate types of intellectual property rights that create excludability for non-rival ideas.

We could go deep down the rabbit hole of IP and innovation. For the moment, though, we're just interested in the idea that IP creates the excludable characteristic of non-rival ideas. Note that nothing here says that *more* IP or *stronger* IP necessarily increases innovation. We probably need *some* IP to incent innovation, but it is an open question of how much. We'll come back to that later.

## Economic implications
Instead of getting into the weeds of IP here, let's work out some of the economic implications of having IP in order to generate growth. 

First, from a pure account perspective, remember that we can always break GDP down into three income streams,

$$
Y = wL + RK + \Pi
$$

where $wL$ are the wages paid to labor, $RK$ are the returns paid to capital, and $\Pi$ are the total economic profits paid out. 

Second, a constant returns to scale production function (like the Cobb-Douglas) has the [interesting property](marginal.html) that

$$
Y = MPK \times K + MPL \times L.
$$

Third, we just said above that productivity growth could only occur if there were economic profits that got paid to innovators, or $\Pi >0$. 

Put all three of these together, and you get an intriguing result. It *must* be that $w \leq MPL$ and/or $R \leq MPK$. How do you find this? The first two properties imply that $wL + RK + \Pi = MPK \times K + MPL \times L$. If $\Pi>0$, then $wL + RK < MPK \times K + MPL \times L$, and the only way for that to work is if either (or both) the wage is less than the MPL or the rental rate is less than the MPK.

Growth requires innovation, which requires profits, which requires that rival inputs like labor and capital are paid *less* than their marginal product. This is important enough to warrant a little label

Growth and rival inputs
{: .label .label-green }
**Economic growth in a constant-returns to scale economy implies that rival inputs are not paid their marginal products.**

Based on this, rival inputs like labor and capital need to be "underpaid" relative to their contribution to producing GDP so that we can provide incentives to innovators to come up with better ways to do things. That doesn't mean this must be unfair to labor or capital. It depends on their outlook. It may be that labor and capital are agreeing to take a smaller slice of the pie, in return for the pie growing even faster over time.

Don't endow this with some kind of mystic truth. It is a statement that *if* the economy is constant returns to scale, and *if* innovation requires profits, then rival inputs cannot be paid their marginal products. Those assumptions could be wrong. 

But let's operate as if the assumptions are true, and think about more possible consequences. We've taken the supply of labor and capital to be fixed, for the most part. That is, we haven't provided any model of why people would supply labor or capital to the market, they just do. But it isn't hard to imagine that the supply of these rival inputs would depend on what they are paid. So if wages and capital rents are pushed *down* in order to make room for profits for innovators, then this would presumably push *down* the willingness of people to supply labor and capital. 

If this is true, then allowing profits for innovations doesn't just change the size of the slices of pie, it makes the pie smaller today. Again, this might be worth it. We might accept a smaller pie today, and labor and capital might accept smaller slices of that smaller pie today, if in return we get more innovation and a rapidly growing pie over time.
