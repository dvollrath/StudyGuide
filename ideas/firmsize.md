# Do big firms do more R&D
{: .no_toc }

1. TOC

We are not going to mess around with my own version of this. Take a look at this Substack by Matt Clancy, which talks about evidence that large firms do more R&D, but don't quite do it as well?

[The Size of Firms and the Nature of Innovation](https://mattsclancy.substack.com/p/the-size-of-firms-and-the-nature?r=3s59a&utm_medium=ios&utm_campaign=post)

Then you can listen to this anecdotal story of invention coming from someone who *left* a big company.

Last, it may be a problem to rely on patent statistics to tell us about rates of innovation, because not every new idea or good idea is patented. The recipe for Coca-Cola, for example, isn't patented, they just keep it a secret. The just-in-time inventory system Toyota invented isn't patented. You can't patent things like "this is a good location for a Starbucks" but that too is a productivity-enhancing innovation. 

Clancy has another post on this topic worth reading:
