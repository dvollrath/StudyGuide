## How do we innovate
The Romer and Schumpeterian models have different takes on how innovation works. For Romer, it is new goods that are acquired, for Schumpeterian models it is better quality versions of existing products. Of course, both types exist, but how important are the two types?

[Pete Klenow and Huiyu Li](https://voxeu.org/article/innovative-growth-accounting) attempted to figure that out. It is hard to measure exactly what counts as a "new product" and "higher quality", but they try to make some progress by using available data on establishments. 

Here, you need to appreciate that an establishment is one instance of a firm. The Taco Cabana in the parking garage complex at UH is an establishment of the Taco Cabana firm, for example. Similarly, the Toyota plant in San Antonio is an establishment of the firm Toyota, is another example. 

What Klenow and Li do is assume that a new establishment represents a new *product*. In terms of places like Taco Cabana, that new product is "tacos at that specific location", as opposed to a new type of guacamole. A new Toyota factory will likely be based around a new product, like a new type of car. Not perfect, but not terrible. This is "Romer" growth.

On the other hand, they can measure how much market share each establishment has in its industry. For the Taco Cabana, that might be "fast food purchases in Houston", and for Toyota that could be "car sales". An increase in market share, they argue, represents increases in *quality*. So this is "Schumpeterian" growth.  

To evaluate the importance of different types of growth, they look at growth coming from different ages of firms.
